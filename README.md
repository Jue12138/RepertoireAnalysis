# Repertoire Analysis of American Full-time Symphony Orchestra (2014-2017)
## Introduction:
This repository provides an in-depth analysis of the performance frequency of contemporary classical music works by American symphony orchestras over a three-year span from 2014 to 2017. The aim is to explore trends and predictions in the contemporary classical music domain, addressing common concerns about the state and future of classical music.

## Key Features:
1. Data Extraction: A comprehensive dataset merging and restructuring process that collates performance ratios.
2. Data Visualization: Utilizes scatter plots and violin plots to provide a graphical representation of trends in the performance of contemporary works.
3. Predictive Modeling: Employs linear regression to predict future performance trends based on historical data.

## Highlights:
1. Preliminary observations indicate a steady increase in the proportion of contemporary works performed.
2. Scatter plots showcase individual data points for each orchestra, while violin plots capture the data distribution across years.
3. The linear regression model, supported by residual plots, predicts a stable trend in the performance of contemporary works.

## Conclusion:
Despite occasional concerns regarding the status of classical music, the analysis suggests a substantial presence of contemporary classical music in American symphony orchestras' repertoire. Symphony orchestras appear to be dedicating 30%-40% of their performances to contemporary works, providing significant opportunities for contemporary composers and promoting the evolution of the classical music domain.
